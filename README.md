# NHL Player Search

I am exploring the capabilities of what Python can do, and I find the best way for me to do so is by  incorperating something I'm passionate about, which is usually hockey.
In this project I attempt to connect to the NHL's publicly available API and use it to bring some information to the user, using what I've learned so far in Python.
While I am still learning Python, I will attempt to use what I am learning to constantly update the app for the better. Currently you can only search a player by going through a team's roster, but I hope to do more than that soon.

Eventually, I will connect this project via Flask and bring it to life using React, of which I am already familiar. I will also design a fully functional site that can be used to compare several player's skills, stats, and salary, amongst others.
If you have any suggestions for either the code I'm using or app functions, please feel free to email me at jtlovato@gmail.com
